Cinema Management System is developed with C++. Through customer access, customers can make their choice to either get the information such as movie info, showtime, experiences, promotions as well as terms & conditions or book the movie ticket. Through administrator access, the owner is able to view the record of ticket selling through this system while the workers can perform their tasks such as adding a new record, editing the existing records, deleting the unwanted records and also search for a record. A purchase slip is also provided for the workers after the customers have completed their bookings to continue with the munchies preparation process.
